  {
    question: "How long does the process take?",
    answer:
      "Most Projects are launched in 7 days or less. Final delivery depends on your feedback speed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does it cost?",
    answer:
      "Projects start from $500. No hidden fees, no retainers unless you choose ongoing work.",
  },
  {
    question: "What support do you offer?",
    answer:
      "Full support during delivery, plus optional ongoing help with growth and management.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I own everything once it is done?",
    answer: "Yes. All assets, copy, and designs are 100% yours once paid.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with ongoing marketing?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We handle campaigns, ads, and optimization if you want more than just a one-off project (most do)",
  },
  {
    question: "What if it doesn't work for my business?",
    answer:
      "We scope carefully before starting. If we can't deliver, we won't take the project.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to manage anything technical?",
    answer:
      "No. We handle setup, integrations, and trackingâ€”so you stay focused on running your business.",
  },
  {
    question: "Am I locked into a contract?",
    answer:
      "No long-term lock-ins. Ongoing work is month-to-month and cancelable anytime.",
